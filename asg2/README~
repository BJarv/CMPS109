CS 109
Asg 3- keyvalue
This program stores values in a linked list by key. Allows for 
input by file and by command line.
 
This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Brandon Jarvinen (bjarvine@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Fan Zhang (fzhang12@ucsc.edu)
 
We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.
 
Brandon Jarvinen spent 1 hours working alone.
Fan Zhang spent        1 hours working alone.
We spent               20 hours working together.
Brandon Jarvinen spent 12 hours driving.
Fan Zhang spent        8 hours driving.
