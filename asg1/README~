CS 109
Asg 1- yshell
This shell reads in commands from stdin and writes output to stdout
 
This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Brandon Jarvinen (bjarvine@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Stella Lee (stjilee@ucsc.edu)
 
We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.
 
Brandon Jarvinen spent 6 hours working alone.
Stella Lee spent       6 hours working alone.
We spent               10 hours working together.
Brandon Jarvinen spent 6.5 hours driving.
Stella Lee spent       3.5 hours driving.
